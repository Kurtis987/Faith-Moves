			<h1>About</h1> 
			<p>
				I believe that a lot of the music we listen to that has a good rhythm and
				melody has poisonous lyrics. We get hooked on those melodies and rythms, and
				the negative lyrics stain our brains. Then, those songs become what we recall
				in our idle time.

				The goal of this site is to promote more positivity and help people focus on God.
