# Faith Moves

## Overview

### What is this site for?

I believe that a lot of the music we listen to that has a good rhythm and melody has poisonous lyrics. We get hooked on those melodies and rythms, and the negative lyrics stain our brains. Then, those songs become what we recall in our idle time.

The goal of this site is to promote more positivity and Christian music to help people focus on God.

### What does it do?

This site streams music from Live365. It has some lyrics to songs and some information about some
of the artists

### How does it work?

This site uses Angular JS, and the site is styled with Bootstrap.
The player art and song title comes from a now-playing javascript file from Live 365.
However, I overwrote most of the styling to achieve my personal styling vision.
The original styling was a much larger widget.
